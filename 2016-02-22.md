### NullObject pattern

The NullObject pattern can be pretty useful when you're implementing a Ruby class to be used by other developers.

Consider a `Duration` class you created that's similar to `Time` that has available a `parse` method. For example: 

```ruby
Duration.parse('5000ms').seconds # => 5
Duration.parse('5000ms').milliseconds # => 5000
```

How should you handle invalid input? `Time` in Rails handles it by throwing a `TypeError` or `ArgumentError`.

```ruby
Time.parse(nil) # => TypeError: no implicit conversion of nil into String
Time.parse('')  # => ArgumentError: no time information in ""
```

If a consumer of your class were to use it like so:

```ruby
class Countdown
  def initialize(duration)
    @seconds = duration
  end
  
  def countdown
    @seconds -= 1
  end
end

start_time = params[:start_time]
Countdown.new(Duration.parse(start_time).seconds)
```
You will get the following if `params[:start_time]` returns `nil` (which is highly possible in Rails-land):

```ruby
NoMethodError: undefined method `seconds' for nil:NilClass
```

What should your `Duration` class do with this seemingly invalid input?

You can throw a `TypeError` or an `ArgumentError` with a detailed message like `Time` does, although the former's message is less obvious.

Alternative to all of the above is the `NullObject` pattern. Your `parse` class method can return a `NullObject` where all methods called on it will simply return `nil`. This can be very useful if you're building up a hash for future processing with "optional" values, which will later be rejected.

An example implementation and usecase:

```ruby
# Duration.rb

class Duration
  class << self
    def parse(str)
      return NullObject.new if str.nil?
    end
  end
end

class NullObject
	def method_missing(*args, &block)
		nil
	end
end

def parse_options(params)
  {
    final: Duration.parse(params[:countdown])
  }.reject { |k, v| v.nil? }
end
```
