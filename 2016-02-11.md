### xargs, standard streams, and the `|` command

`xargs` is a nifty command that can read an arbitrary list of arguments from standard input, and applies them to the command following it.

#### Example
(following example credit goes to [coderwall](https://coderwall.com/p/x3jmig/remove-all-your-local-git-branches-but-keep-master))

Delete all local branches that match an expression:

`git branch | grep -v <expression> | xargs git branch -D`

#### Explanation
*(After a great discussion with a coworker)*

The first piped (`|`) command lists all git branches and prints to standard output.
The second piped command reads from standard input (`grep` is capable of reading from STDIN), matches against `<expression>`, and outputs the results to STDOUT. The final command reads from STDIN again, similar to the second command, and enumerates over each result by passing the result into `git branch -D` as an argument.

The reason `xargs` is necessary is because `git branch -D` cannot read from STDIN. 

#### Reasoning
For me, I always considered the output from STDOUT simply as the equivalent of any string object in most languages. `git branch -D` was the function I believed that could take any string as an argument, and do some processing with it. The `|` command, I believed, would take the string output from the command on the left, and simply use that as the string argument to be used in the command on the right.

This simple mental model can work for relatively simple commands such as `grep <exp> | grep <exp>`, and it helped get me through most simple shell command needs.

The key difference between the correct mental model and the incorrect one, is that the pipe command *actually* takes the standard output from the left, and *pipes* it into the command on the right, as standard input. STDOUT, STDIN, and STDERR, are all part of a system called standard streams. They are basically a type of communication channel that primarily deals with the movement of text.

There are methods that *can* read from STDIN such as `grep`, but there are methods such as `git branch -D` that cannot.

#### Conclusion
My biggest takeaway from this is the mental refactor of how I assumed standard stream text worked. `xargs` was the very first method that I came across in my shell experience, which has a very different kind of method signature than simply reading a string argument passed in.

There are some nice wiki articles on [standard streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams) and [xargs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs).
