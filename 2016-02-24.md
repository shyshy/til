### npm link

At Movable Ink, we have a large Javascript application (Ember) that takes advantage of some nifty reusable components. These components have been generalized to the point that we have been able to pull them out, into a shared git repo so other Ember applications can use them.

My workflow when implementing a new component / behavior, has been to think of the solution as straight forward as possible, completely specific to the context of the application. Eventually, reusable behavior becomes obvious, and a reusable component is born. Maybe your goal was to have a toggable list, resulting in a `select-list` component that's a list of `select-list-items` that can be toggled on and off.

This component still exists in the context of the application, and development is driven by it's usecase in the application. My goal would be then to move this component out to our shared git repo, but, still interact with it in the application.

I could `cp -f <path to shared git repo dir> <path to application dir>` everytime I wanted to test, but, that would be extremely tedious.

In comes `npm link`.

I can run `npm link` from the top level directory of the shared git repo,
which will set a symlink to this directory under my current node version module directory. Then I can move to my application directory, run `npm link <shared git directory name>`, and another symlink from my local `node_modules` project will be linked to the shared repo inside my main node version's modules.

In otherwords, I can basically work on files in my shared git repo, without having to copy over the changes to my application directory.
