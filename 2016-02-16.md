### Dropping tables carefully

When cleaning up unused code, especially migrating + dropping tables, it's worth separating out the code clean-up from the migrations.

Take for example, a trivial view / scenario:

```erb
<h1>Posts</h1>

<ul>
  <% @posts.each do |post| %>
    <li><%= link_to post.title, post %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

A user loads up this page in their browser, but, maybe leaves the tab open, goes on vacation, goes out for lunch, etc.

In the meantime, your dev team decides your `posts` table is no longer needed, so you decide to push out a migration that drops the table from your production database.

Users who are still holding onto older versions of your application can still hit your controllers that may still have code that queries this dropped table. Your database will throw an exception, which will bubble up as a `500 Error`.

#### Caveat

This is less likely to happen in a standalone Rails application. It's more likely to happen if you have a front-facing application and your Rails app works as the CRUD API endpoints.
