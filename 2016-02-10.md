### grep `<pattern>` | grep `<pattern>`

This is a simple one. Grep commands can be piped into the other, to search in a more intuitive way for those who don't touch regex daily.

ex. Deprecation in Ember requires all `store#find(type)` to change to `store#findAll(type)`. We want every call for combinations of `getStore.find` or
`this.get('store')`, etc.


`grep -i 'find' | grep -i 'store'`
