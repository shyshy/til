### `string` vs `text` ActiveRecord column types

The key difference between `string` and `text` type columns in ActiveRecord, depends on how your underlying database implements their character types. It's usually assumed that `text` refers to a column that holds string values of indeterminate length, while `string` holds values of a certain limit.

In ActiveRecord, a column declared like so:

```ruby
class AddPostsTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
	 create_table :posts do |t|
		t.string  :title
		t.text    :body
	 end
  end
end
```

Produces the following in Postgres for the `users` table:

```
Column	|  Type  
--------+--------
title	|  character varying(255)
body	|  text
```

[Postgres Docs](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/datatype-character.html) for `character varying(n)` describes the column as having a maximum length of `n`.

### Conclusion

Be ready to validate attributes on your model that have a `string` type to be of a certain limit. You never know what your user will input into a text field.

It's quite easy to then trigger a `500 Internal Server Error` if the transaction makes it all the way to your database, which then throws the exception. As opposed to a much more manageable `422 Unprocessable Entity` if the validation catches it first.

e.g. `validates_length_of :title, maximum: 255`
